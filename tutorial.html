            <h2>How to use</h2>
            <p>
                To use the AI art generator, you will need a computer with a dedicated graphics card.
                You will also need to install the program and it's requirements. 
                You can find the requirements and installation instructions in the get started video.
                Once you have the program installed, you can open it and start making art.
            
            </p>
            <h2>Making your first piece of art</h2>
            <p>
                First run the program. You will see a terminal open. It will run for a minute or two starting the 
                processes it needs. Once it is done, you will see a link to a local host (IP address). Click on the 
                link and it will your stable diffusion model. This is the model that will be used to make your art.
                There are a lot of options witch can be confusing, but don't worry, you don't need to know what they
                all do yet. Mainly you will be using the text box labeled prompt. This is where you will type in what
                you want the AI to make art of. For example, if you type in "a red apple" the AI will make art of a red apple.
                Then you will see a button that says generate. Click on it and the AI will make art of a red apple. Try it now!
            </p>

            <h2>How to make better art</h2>
            <p>
                Now that you know how to make art, you will want to know how to make better art. There are a few ways to do this.
                First, you can change the model. The model is what the AI uses to make art. There are a lot of models to choose from.
                You can find a list of models on <a href="https://civitai.com/" target="_blank">Civitai.com</a>. To change the model, 
                you will need to go back to the terminal and stop the program. Then you will need to download the model you want to use.
                Then place the model into the models/stable-diffusion folder. Then you will need to go back to the terminal and start the program again.
