    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>I have been playing around with AI art generation so i want to use this site to 
        show off what i've made so far. I also want to use this site to educate people about
        how AI art works. I will also use this site to show off my art made by AI and the
        technics I've learned. I will also use this site to show people how they can get started.
    </p>

    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>
      Any one who might be interested in AI generated art. This has been a trendy topic as of late so I'm
      sure lots of people will be interested. My target is people who are interested as a hobby. 
      I wont be able to show them how to make AI art in a professional setting or use. 
      This is more to show off and get people interested in AI art.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      To best cater to the intended audience I should:<br>
      Give a brief explanation to AI art and what kind of AI model I use.<br>
      Give lots of examples of art that I generated and the prompts i used.<br>
      Show people how they can get started using AI to make there own art.<br>
    </p>
